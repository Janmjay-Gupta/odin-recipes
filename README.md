# odin-recipes

This is the first project in "The Odin Project" under the "Foundations" part where I learned html elements and tags like lists, img, headings and so much more.

This page is build using all these html tags/elements
As of now this is a very basic html page, but as I proceed with the course, we will be styling this page to make it look beautiful.
